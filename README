this is a very specific little script for the [crow by monome and whimsical raps](https://monome.org/docs/crow/)

it's used to take a single 0-5v control voltage signal and address some matching chords on [akemi's](https://busycircuits.com/alm011/) and [sid's guts deluxe](https://busycircuits.com/alm012/) by alm busy circuits.

a chord map and voltage boundaries are provided in the lua code for [Cizzle](https://busycircuits.com/alm042/), but the code as run does not output any chord addres for that module -- be sure to edit the code as you need to if you want to address the cizzle and just have one chord inv output.


the script as written now sets the following I/O:

INPUT 1: 0-5v chord address
INPUT 2: chord inversion address
--
OUTPUT 1: Sid's Guts Deluxe chord address
OUTPUT 2: Sid's Guts Deluxe inversion address
OUTPUT 3: Akemi's Castle chord address
OUTPUT 4: Akemi's Castle inversion address
