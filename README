this is a very specific little script for the [crow by monome and whimsical raps](https://monome.org/docs/crow/)

to take a 1v/oct signal and address some chords on [akemi's castle by alm busy circuits](https://busycircuits.com/alm011/).

I use it to take the first octave of my sequencer keyboard to adress the chord of channel A of akemi's castle.

Todo:
map out the chord inversions and set up input 2 to address inversions
